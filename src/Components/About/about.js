This website was created so that you can become an expert on your own health.  When I first became interested in plant based nutrition, it took me years of searching to find the best science and information from trusted sources.  I hope to make this endeavor much simpler for you.  Adjusting to this lifestyle can feel daunting and it is a major change--one that is SO worth it!  I want to give you the tools you need to make the transition simple.  You can utilize my ‘free resources’ page to get information from the experts about topics of personal interest.  Each series on the main page was created to give you detailed, useful information in small bites to help you create health for you and your family.  The dig deeper page is full of in-depth videos for individuals seeking information about issues specific to men, women, families, hormonal health, and the environment.

Through this platform I seek to empower individuals with scientific information to help make our world a healthier place.  I hope to generate enough income from this platform to be able to bless my family and people in need in the United States and throughout the world through humanitarian efforts.  I hope to leave this world better than I found it.  Your support enables me to bless the life of my own family and many families around the globe, and for that I am eternally grateful!
