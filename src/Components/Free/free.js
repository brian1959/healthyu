            Nearly half of Americans take at least one prescription medicine,
            with almost a quarter taking three or more, as diseases such as
            diabetes, obesity, and dementia grow more prevalent than ever. The
            problem with medicating common ailments, such as high blood pressure
            or elevated cholesterol, is that drugs treat symptoms—and may even
            improve test results—without addressing the cause: diet.

            cheese can be dangerous. Loaded with calories, fat, and cholesterol,

            Diet for a New America is a startling examination of the food we

            Global Integrity Project has brought together leading scientists and
            thinkers from around the world to examine the combined problems of
            threatened and unequal human well-being, degradation of the
            ecosphere, and unsustainable economies. Based on the proposition
            that healthy, functioning ecosystems are a necessary prerequisite
            for both economic security and social justice, the project is built
            around the concept of ecological integrity and its practical
            implications for policy and management.Ecological Integrity presents
            a synthesis and findings of the project
